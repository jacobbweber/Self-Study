# Purpose
This "Powershell-Lab-Hyperv" project utilizes PowerShell to read and utilize .json "build" files to create and remove specific environments. Initially, this was created as a way to experiment with PowerShell and to streamline the process of building a lab based on a Windows domain. However, it is unlikely that this project will continue to be developed, as it will be replaced by terraform/ansible. Any plain text passwords present in this project are only relevant to the non-production lab environment.
